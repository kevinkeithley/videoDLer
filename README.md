# videoDLer
A python script to download videos from websites. 

## Motivation
I have purchased numerous courses online, and I would like to have a local copy of some of the videos. Some courses I purchased have had their sites gone down, so I no longer have access.
Others provide access for a certain amount of time before I will no longer have access. Because of this, I want the ability to easily download a set of these videos so I have a local copy.
